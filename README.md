# Nuwe_Schneider_Electric_20220521
Team 25 submission from Leane Macachor, Alicja Mankowska, and Kyla Juett 

Team 25 had fun!

We enjoyed working with real data, & appreciate Schneider Electric & Nuwe for making it possible for this group of former bootcamp classmates to code together again as a team.

Can't wait for the next hackathon!
